## React with Vite

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new React project using `vite`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

### Add Tailwind and its configuration
Install `tailwindcss` and its peer dependencies, then generate your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › › src/index.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › src/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › src/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no / yes (no)
```

### Edit tsconfig.json
Add the code below to the compilerOptions of your tsconfig.json so components can import utils without error

```bash
"baseUrl": ".",
```

### Update vite.config.ts
Add the code below to the vite.config.ts so components can import utils without error

```bash
# (so you can import "path" without error)
npm i -D @types/node
```

```typescript
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: [
      { find: "src", replacement: path.resolve(__dirname, "./src/") },
],
  },
});
```

</Steps>

That's it. You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add
```

## Other frameworks

I'm looking for help writing guides for other frameworks. Help me write guides for Remix and Astro by [opening an PR](https://github.com/shadcn/ui).
