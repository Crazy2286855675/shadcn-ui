## VS Code Tailwind CSS Extension

The [Tailwind extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
provides additional features that improve the Tailwind development experience. You can find a full list
of them [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code).

### IntelliSense inside of `cva` and `cn`

The extension's features only work inside of the default class attributes by default. To make them work
inside of `cva` and `cn`, you need to add the following to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    ["cva\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"],
    ["cn\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
  ]
}
```

Follow the same pattern for any other function you use to generate class names in your code. For example:

- `tw` from [twin.macro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twin.macro)

```json
["tw\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
```

## Other editors

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#jet-brains-ides) provide a plugin for Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.
- In Neovim, you can install the Tailwind CSS Language Server for [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#tailwindcss)

## Class sorting

There are two main ways to sort your Tailwind classes.

### prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

If you are using prettier, you can use Tailwind's official
[prettier plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier). Follow
their [installation instructions](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss#installation)
to get started.

The plugin also only targets classes in the
[default `class` attributes](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss#sorting-non-standard-attributes).
However, it exposes the equivalent of the Tailwind extension's `tailwind.classAttributes` through
`tailwindAttributes` and `tailwindFunctions` respectively:

```js
// prettier.config.js
module.exports = {
  tailwindAttributes: ["myCustomClassNameAttribute"],
  tailwindFunctions: ["cn", "clsx", "twMerge", "tw"],
}
```

### Headwind

There is also an unofficial VS Code extension which functions without prettier. It provides a few
additional features like running on save and removing duplicate classes. You can install it from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind).

Headwind also only targets the default `class` attributes by default. However, it exposes the equivalent
of the Tailwind extension's `tailwind.experimental.classRegex` through
[`headwind.classRegex`](https://github.com/heybourn/headwind#headwindclassregex).
