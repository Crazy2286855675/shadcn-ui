Introduction **shadcn/charts**. A collection of chart components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

The charts are designed to look great out of the box. They work well with the other components and are fully customizable to fit your project.

## Composition

We use [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) under the hood.

We designed the `chart` component with composition in mind i.e you compose Recharts components and only bring in custom components, such as `ChartTootlip`, where you need it.

```tsx showLineNumbers /ChartContainer/ /ChartTooltipContent/
import { Bar, BarChart } from "recharts"

import { ChartContainer, ChartTooltipContent } from "@/components/charts"

export function MyChart() {
  return (
    <ChartContainer>
      <BarChart data={data}>
        <Bar dataKey="value" />
        <ChartTooltip content={<ChartTooltipContent />} />
      </BarChart>
    </ChartContainer>
  )
}
```

We do not wrap Recharts components. This means you're not locked into an abstraction. When a new Recharts version is released, you can follow the official upgrade path.

The components are yours.
