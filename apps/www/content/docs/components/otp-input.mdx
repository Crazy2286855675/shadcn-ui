## Examples

### Basic Usage

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-demo" />

### With custom number inputs

You can customize the number of inputs by passing the `numInputs` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-custom-number" />

### With custom placeholder

By default the placeholder is `_`. You can customize it by passing the `placeholder` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-placeholder" />

### With separator

Sometimes you may need to have a separator between each generated input. For this case we have the `renderSeparator` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-separator" />

### Controlling the value

You can control the value of the OTP input by passing the `value` and `onChange` props.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-controlled" />

### Detecting onPaste event

You can detect the `onPaste` event by passing the `onPaste` prop.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-on-paste" />

### Auto focus

You can set the `autoFocus` prop to `true` to automatically focus the first input.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-autofocus" />

### With Form

You can use the OTPInput component with the Form component.

<ComponentPreview name="otp-input-form" />

### With Server Actions

The component renders by default this line of code

```tsx
<input type="hidden" id={id} name={name} value={otpValue} />
```

This allows to have a hidden input for the form you use with server actions and you can capture it inside the FormData. It is important that you set the `name` prop to be included inside the FormData.
